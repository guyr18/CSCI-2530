# CSCI-2530
# Assignment 1
  This assignment required that the median and mean of a set of integers, seperated by spaces, were computed. 
  The median of the first three integers provided is computed, and then the remaining integer(s) are summed up and
  a mean value is calculated. Once the standard input reads in a -1 the mean computation ends. The design and algorithm
  is further described with documentation within 'average.cpp'.
