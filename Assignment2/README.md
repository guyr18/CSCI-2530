# CSCI-2530
This assignment is designed to accept a single integer input and a collatz conjecture (or "hailstone sequence") regarding
this integer. There is a variety of informative statistics concerning the largest and longest sequence in a set of
numbers ranging from 1 to n. This is further described and documented within 'hailstone.cpp'.

All functions in this application are iterative in nature.
