# Assignment 7
Assignment 7 represented a <b>discrete event simulation</b> by incorporating <b>Dijkstra's</b> shortest path algorithm.

# Background
 -> A discrete event simulation performs a simulation of a collection of events, where each event occurs at a specified time. 
 \n-> Dijkstra's algorithm finds shortest paths in weighted graphs, and it can be expressed as a discrete event simulation.
 
# More Information..
  This application uses Dijkstra's shortest
 path algorithm and reads information about
 a weighted graph from the standard input.
 And furthermore, has three components:
  1. An input graph description that is
     derived from the standard input.
  2. The shortest path from the starting
     vertex to the ending vertex.
  3. The distance (or time) from the starting
     vertex to the ending vertex. This is
     derived from the shortest path.
  
  Conclusively, this assignment presented the challenge of integrating arrays, structures, linked lists and switchable
  tracing within a single application. This assignment was considered a "final project" for <b>CSCI 2530</b>.
