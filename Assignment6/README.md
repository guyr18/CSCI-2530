Assignment 6 required students to develop a <b>priority queue</b> using modules. As a bit of background, a <b>priority queue</b>
is a collection of items that each have a priority. A priority queue supports three fundamental operations:

1. You can ask a priority queue whether it is empty.

2. You can insert an item into the priority queue with a given priority.

3. You can remove the item from the priority queue that has the smallest priority.

As a final note, this priority queue implementation makes use of a commonly used abstract data type in Computer Science: <b>Linked List</b>.
