In <b>Assignment 4</b>, I was instructed to implement a module that represents an equivalence relation set from {1, ..., n}.
This is not an application, and furthermore is an equivalence relation manager. It allows a developer to manage, combine,
and test the equivalency of equivalence relation sets.

Function prototypes are provided in 'equiv.h', and are coupled with specific type definition(s).
Implementations are provided in 'equiv.cpp'.
All code is documented and elaborated upon.
