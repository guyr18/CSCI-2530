# CSCI-2530
# Assignment 3
Much like <b>Assignment 2</b>, this assignment requests a design of a Collatz Conjecture (or "hailstone sequence"). Ultimately, producing informative statistics regarding said sequence. <b>Assignment 3</b>
differs in the fact that a recursive implementation of ALL functions is required. This is further documented and described
in 'hailstone.cpp'.
