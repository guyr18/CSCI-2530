# CSCI-2530
# Prerequisite Knowledge
This assignment requires the previously written module from <b>Assignment 4</b>. It includes the corresponding files
in 'mst.cpp' as part of a primary algorithm.

# Assignment 5
This assignment accepts input signifying the following:
  <li>The number of vertices</li>
  <li>The starting and ending vertex, per edge component</li>
  <li>A respective weight, per weight component</li>
  <br></br>
  
This input then makes use of <b>Kruskal's algorithm</b> to compute
a weighted graph. Subsequently, this weighted graph uses the
equivalence relation manager to generate a minimal spanning tree.

Input and function intent is described extensively within 'mst.cpp'.
This application was designed to provide experience in integrating a
module with an application. And furthermore, to give a practical example
of using arrays of structures & compound selectors; namely edges.
