This repository represents the coursework (programming assigments) that I have completed throughout my enrollment of CSCI 2530.
This repository includes several folders, which are intended to showcase basic fundamental programming concepts along with
my familiarity of common data structures, algorithms, and string utility functions.

All coursework completed is done so in C++.
