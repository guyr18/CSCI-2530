# Background Information & Purpose
This repository represents the coursework (programming assigments) that I have completed throughout CSCI 2530.
This repository includes several folders, which are intended to showcase basic fundamental programming concepts along with
my familiarity of common data structures, memory control, and other algorithms.

All coursework is completed in C++ using the GNU Compiler.
If you would like to experiment with the source code
provided in this repository I recommend that you test
such code with the following flags in a G++ or GNU
